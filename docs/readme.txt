1. INTRODUCTION
===============

Vandomizer is a vanilla randomizer mod for GZDoom. By "vanilla randomizer", I mean
that the mod does not include any custom weapons or monsters - rather, it merely
randomizes the pre-existing Doom things. That's the general goal of the mod anyway.


2. REQUIREMENTS
===============

Vandomizer requires GZDoom 4.3.0 at a minimum to run. It is currently only compatible
with Doom 2. Compatibility for Ultimate Doom is planned down the line, however. I may
also implement Heretic and Hexen compatibility in the future.


3. RUNNING THE MOD
==================

To run the mod, all you need to do is drag vandomizer-master.zip over gzdoom.exe or
use your launcher of choice to load the mod.


4. CREDITS
==========

Vandomizer is created by Santtu "MFG38" Pesonen.
